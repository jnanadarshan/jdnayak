# Let's talk about the HomeLab

Of all the things I do, homelab is probably the most interesting thing I work on. My homelab started with one Raspberry Pi brought over from the US by a friend. Now, it has spiraled to 6 Single Board Computers (SBC) including Pi 4, Pi Zero 2 W, and an Orange Pi. These systems run various Operating Systems depending on the use case. Most of the Pi 4s run Raspberry Pi OS and Openmediavault on top. Some use the latest Debian versions and docker on top. In addition to the SBCs, I have three AMD powered systems running as servers for various tasks. I have a Ryzen 1600 for my VMs, a Ryzen 3600 for Proxmox Server running LXC Containers and VMs that are headless, and an Athlon 3000G running Truenas Scale. I am planning to put a dedicated Homelab page here soon. Stay tuned.
